## Student Feedback

> I also feel like compared to other math classes offered, statistics is the most accessible for those who identify as low-income or maybe do not want to pay an exorbitant amount of money for a textbook, access code, and web assign.

## What I have found useful

- Take advantage of OER support and expertise

- Look for Multiple Funding Sources

- Use/learn collaboration tools

- Iterate and plan for maintenance
